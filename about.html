            <h1>Who We Are</h1>
            <p>We have dedicated years of service to the mobile industry and over the years, we have only gotten better. We specialize in hardware repairs on smartphones, other mobile devices like tablets and desktop class devices such as laptops and game consoles. However, our skills go further than general repairs. Micro-soldering and board level repairs have become a pinnacle of electronics repair. Difficult to learn and even more difficult to perform properly, it didn't stop us from trying and we are proud to deliver this service. <br><br>
            Good enough is not good enough if it can be better. But better is not better if it can be the best. This is who we are.</p>

              <h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>How long do repairs usually take to complete?</li>
                <p>Most repairs can be done within the same day. Others like micro-soldering jobs may take longer depending on the difficulty of the entire repair.</p>

                <li>What forms of payment do you accept?</li>
                <p>Credit Cards (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Amex) and Paypal for online payments.  Credit cards are also accepted for in-store payments as well as cash.</p>

                <li>What do I do if I have problems after a repair soon afterwards or at some point?</li>
                <p>If you have any problems, kindly contact us preferrably by phone or email and we'll do our best to help you out once you bring it back in.</p>

                <li>Do you accept swaps? A repair in exchange for a device?</li>
                <p>Sometimes but not always.</p>

                <li>What happens if I forget to pick my device up?</li>
                <p>After a certain amount days, at least 14 and/or a maximum of 30 days, we take possession of your device and discard or use it however we want. However, we will attempt to call and remind you to pick your device up before doing so.</p>

                <li>Do you reject repairs?</li>
                <p>We do. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone and any device for any reason whatsoever.</p>

                <li>I have more questions. Can you help me?</li>
                <p>Of course. Feel free to call us during our business hours and we'll help you with what you need.</p>

        <!-- WARRANTY -->
        <div class="mail-in">

              <h1>WARRANTY</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>How does your warranty work?</li>
                <p>We offer warranties for devices we repair against any factory defects for the parts we replaced and worked on. So long as that part, for example the screen, is not damaged for any reason whatsoever, we will replace it with no cost unless otherwise noted in some circumstances.</p>

                <li>What if there is accidental or unnoticed damage on the part you replaced even though the defect came up before the damage?</li>
                <p>We are not able to offer a full warranty in this case because our supplier rejects any returns for defective parts that have damage in them. However, we will work with you on pricing so you don't end up paying as much as you paid the first time you got the repair.</p>

                <li>Do I need a receipt?</li>
                <p>It's best to keep your receipts in case we need to verify your repairs. We reserve the right to reject your warranty claim if we cannot verify your repair through a valid receipt. However, there could also be cases when we do not require a receipt for any warranty repairs as long as we're able to verify its validity in some other way.</p>

                <li>Are there limitations to your warranties?</li>
                <p>Yes. Liquid damage repairs are usually not warrantied because of the nature of unforseen damages that can progress and take effect at any given time. We are able to warranty liquid damage repairs within a short time, usually from the time we hand you the device up until a few days after that. However, we are not always able to do this. Kindly discuss this with your technician if you have any concerns.</p>

                <li>What if I decide to be an a$$hole?</li>
                <p>We don't tolerate that kind of behavior. Go somewhere else. We don't need your business. Have a nice day.</p>

              <h1>RETURNS</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>Can I return an item I bought through your store?</li>
                <p>All sales are final and returns are not accepted.</p>

                <li>Do you accept exchanges?</li>
                <p>Yes. But only if the item is defective or you may have accidentally bought the wrong one. We can only exchange items bought the same day or the next unless otherwise noted. Items subject for exhanges must be in new and unused condition including the packaging it came with.</p>

                <li>I no longer need an item I bought. Can you buy it back?</li>
                <p>Nope.</p>

                <li>I got a repair and I no longer need it. Can I return your part in exchange for a refund?</li>
                <p>Certainly not. We don't rent out repairs. Repairs are final and can only be warrantied or switched for a different repair that has a similar price.</p>
